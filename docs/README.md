## Implementation Status

Based on the whitepaper analysis:

- **Foundation (40% complete):** Core architecture and LibreChat integration
- **CLI Interface (5% complete):** Basic REPL, missing 80+ commands
- **Storage (60% complete):** Database design, file structure planned
- **Security (35% complete):** Permission framework, sandboxing needed
- **Registry (30% complete):** Architecture planned, implementation needed
- **Tools (45% complete):** MCP framework exists, integration needed
- **Performance (45% complete):** Context management good, optimization needed
- **Enterprise (25% complete):** RBAC framework, features needed
- **Installation (0% complete):** Completely missing

## Development Approach

### LibreChat Integration Benefits

- **90% code reuse** from proven agent architecture
- **Battle-tested** multi-agent orchestration
- **Sophisticated context management** with summarization
- **Comprehensive tool integration** framework
- **Enterprise-grade security** patterns

### CLI-Optimized Changes

- **SQLite instead of MongoDB** for 10-50x better CLI performance
- **TypeScript for reliability** with compile-time error checking
- **File-based configuration** for Git integration and portability
- **Command-line focused UX** rather than web interface

## Getting Started

1. **Read the [Architecture Overview](architecture/README.md)** to understand the system design
2. **Review [Command Reference](cli-interface/commands.md)** for CLI interface details
3. **Study [Storage Design](storage/README.md)** for data architecture
4. **Examine [Code Examples](examples/)** for implementation patterns

## Contributing

This documentation is built incrementally as the system is implemented. Each component includes:

- **Architecture overview** with diagrams
- **TypeScript interfaces** and type definitions
- **Implementation examples** with LibreChat integration
- **Code samples** showing usage patterns
- **Testing strategies** and validation approaches

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):** Core CLI framework and basic commands
**Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4):** Agent system and management
**Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6):** Context and memory management
**Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8):** Multi-agent orchestration
**Phase 5 (Weeks 9-10):** Community registry and security
**Phase 6 (Weeks 11-12):** Enterprise features and optimization

Total estimated timeline: **26-33 weeks** for full implementation matching the whitepaper specification.
